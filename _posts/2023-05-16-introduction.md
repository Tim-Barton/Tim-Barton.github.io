Hi, my name is Tim.  
This is me -> ![headshot](/img/headshot-2022.jpg)

I've been into technology all my life and love to solve problems, so it was no surprise to anyone that I went to university and graduated with a Bachelor in IT (Software Engineering).

From almost Day 1 as a newly minted Developer I was thrown in the deep end, becoming main support dev for a greenfield app that had no supporting documentation, no code comments (that's a little bit exaggerated, there was *one* comment - a quote from Blade Runner), and while MVP deployable was still not complete. A trial by fire to be sure, but I made it through mostly unscathed (nobody is perfect, least of all me) and with an appreciation for what does and does not make a program nice for the next person to pick up. It's also the point where the seed of my focus on the Team was formed - no successful piece of software stays a one-person show, so the Team that surrounds it as a collective is more important than any single individual (generally).

A victim of my own success (and not for the last time) it was not long after I was asked to act as the Tech Liaison for a retail terminal replacement project. The experienced members of Tech had filled in the RFI requirements we needed, my job was to work with the Marketing sponsor to explain what we needed, why, and be in the room with him to answer any tech-related questions that he had. As an exposure to the business side of things, I couldn't have asked for a better introduction. It showed me that generally speaking "Business" and "Tech" want the same outcomes, they just have different focuses, but if you can create a common language you can create a common understanding.

It was a few years later that a funny thing happened. I was working on a multi-year program for a new product, Tech Leading a small group from within my team, writing Tech requirements for an internal development team and acting as Tech Liaison with an external development house. I realised around this time that the problems I wanted to solve were no longer the Tech problems - those were easy - what I wanted to solve were the meta-problems like:  

* How do you get a team to work well together?
* How do you manage a project that's changing?
* What is the best way to deliver software?

Or, simply put - "How do you let developers do what they do best?"

A few more years went by as I gained more experience, until finally (and after some time with a foot in each camp) I joined the lowest ranks of management as a Team Leader - or "promoted into useless" as an old colleague put it. My job was now to solve those meta-problems in order to get the best out of my team.

And you know what? I *like* that job.

* I like seeing developers being able to do what they do best and deliver great products to the customer.
* I like seeing developers learn and grow because the practices we follow give them the chance.
* I like seeing a group of developers form into a team that is able tackle unknowns efficiently and without panic.

### So what is this site?  

First and foremost it's a place where I can start collecting my thoughts on practices and approaches to build out my personal playbook. Somewhere other than my head like I have been for the last few years.  
Of course I could have just done that in a Google doc, or some other note-taking app, but by being public I hope I can help someone else figure out what works for them, and generally help people beyond my immediate sphere of influence.

### What should you expect?  

I don't want anyone to take what I write here as some sort of gospel truth, the site name is deliberate - these are the opinions of one guy who's worked in the Dev trenches and wants to make things better for everyone. I am not perfect, never have been, never will be, but I hope that by writing here I can help guide people down a path I think is good.

That said, I do believe my views follow some broad general tenets that might appeal to you:

#### Is it practical?

Most software teams are working within the context of a business, and while "Business" and "Tech" should be aligned on the outcomes, there are some things that a "Business" needs (or think they need) that are at odds with good Development Practices. The best Ways of Working are a healthy balance between the two, but are still achievable.

#### There is no such thing as perfect

Firstly in the sense that every approach has it's pros & cons where you need to ensure the former outweigh the later. Also in the sense that every practice you follow can either be wrong for a given scenario, or become generally sub-optimal in the long run as your teams/business/needs change, so don't get stuck thinking that your practices are "perfect".

#### If in doubt, start lite

Process creates a structure to the way you do things, a structure that is designed to help people work more effectively, but also creates a rigidity to how you approach things. Sometimes that rigidity will start to hurt your business and you need to change or remove a process, but I've found people don't like this and will resist you. Since *adding* a process is usually easier than *removing* one, I prefer starting with something lite and adding to it, rather than going whole hog and realising you've gone too far
