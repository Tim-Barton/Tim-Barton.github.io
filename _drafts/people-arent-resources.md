Anyone who's worked with me in the last few years has more than likely heard me say "people are not resources" followed shortly after by "and this is the hill I will die on". I usually make this statement in response to someone talking about "Resource plans" or saying something like "we're low on resources" and it comes from the firmly rooted, completely unshakeable belief that talking about Software Engineers as "resources" Is the single biggest blight affecting our industry.

Yeah if you thought my previous posts were opinionated (to be fair, they are) then strap in - we're in new territory now.

# What do I blame?
In two words: The PMBOK

In more words: Poor Project Managers (PM) who think Engineers are somehow interchangeable cogs in their project delivery plans.

To be clear, I have worked with some great PMs, some good ones and even a few defendable ones. I've also worked with bad PMs, the type that would sour someone from ever working with a PM again if they hadn't worked with a good one. What separate the good PMs from the objectively horrible ones is the understanding that an Engineer is a unique individual with a special skillset that can't just replaced to keep their project in track.

The other way to put it is bad PMs think that an "Engineer" is a unit that can be replaced or rationalised around. If you've worked in Software Engineering for a while you might have heard the joke that if a pregnant woman can create a baby in 9 months, then according to PMs 9 women should be able to create a baby in 1 month.

I believe this poor understanding stems from the Project Management Bible - the PMBOK or Project Management Body Of Knowledge. Very specifically the PMBOK has an entire chapter dedicated to Resource Management, which as defined in Wikipedia (and as taught to me many moons ago) is

`Project Resource Management : the processes that organize, manage, and lead the project team.`

As an exercise I want you to list down all the things you think of as "Resources".

Chances are I expect your list contains things like:
* Pens
* Paper
* Printers
* Petrol

(It's only as in write this I realise my usual examples are all P words )

What all these things have in common is they are usually:
- easily purchasable from a store
- normally with very little lead time,
- while their prices may differ, any difference in quality is usually negligible.

This in no way describes Engineers, and yet I have on multiple occasions had a conversation along the lines of
Me: Engineer X is going on leave for 2 weeks and their tasks are on the critical path
