Author's Note:  
This is not one of the topics I expected to be writing about, but an old colleague asked to hear my take on the toll they have, and me being me, I couldn't help but try to provide some practical advice at the same time.  

This is a mixture of my own experiences, advice I have received from old colleagues that have also gone through the experience, and advice I've picked up from employment consultants. Will it be the same for everyone, No, but hopefully there's some things here that can help you **when** it happens

Also a lot of this will be specific to Australian laws and whatnot, so it may be completely different where you live.

Redundancies suck.  

Hot take, I know. No-one in the history of the planet has ever had that thought before </sarcasm>

What's hard to understand before going through one is that redundancies also *hurt*.

I've been made redundant twice. Sorry, *my role* has been made redundant twice (we'll get to that later), and both times it's hurt, though in different ways.

My first redundancy came after almost 12 years at the company, and it wasn't even a surprise. I'd started my 11th year already beginning to feel like it was time to leave, and as I started to slowly burn out over that year, the fact the new CIO was saying lots of things implying a mass restructure excited me. There was a real possibility I could take a redundancy, allowing me to move on without leaving my team in the lurch and get a nice big cheque to help find my next opportunity. Months ahead of the actual redundancy meeting it became clear my role was on the chopping block when the planned new structures were shown off. Even after the meeting I was excited by the possibilities ahead of me and given they still needed to fill in the new structure I had months to figure out what I wanted to do before my end date would even be set.

All of this is to say that I had months to prepare mentally, and all the reasons in the world to be positive, but none of it stopped the redundancy itself hitting me like a truck, leaving me in tears.

I don't mean a single stoic Hollywood perfect tear as I look off into the sunset. I have the vivid memory of sitting on my back steps, full body sobbing, tears streaming down my face as my dog pressed herself into me - a full on ugly cry.

It was not the only time.

So yeah, redundancies hurt.

## What can I do to protect myself against them?

Short answer: Nothing

Longer answer: You can't stop a redundancy, you can only make yourself more resilient for when they occur.

In Australia a redundancy is defined as:
> Redundancy is when a business no longer needs an employeeâ€™s role to be done by anyone.  
>source: [Fair Work Australia](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/ending-employment/redundancy)

Reading further there are even examples of what can cause a redundancy to occur:

>Redundancy can happen when the business:
> - introduces new technology (for example, the job can be done by a machine)
> - slows down due to lower sales or production
> - closes down
> - relocates interstate or overseas
> - restructures or reorganises because a merger or takeover happens.

The key here is that a redundancy has nothing to do with your personal work ethic / output / results, but with the overarching health and direction of the business. You can be the best widget maker in the world, but if your employer decides to exit the widget business, they no longer need your role.

Anyone who's lived through COVID, or the GFC before that, or '[the recession we had to have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession_in_Australia#%22The_recession_we_had_to_have%22)' even before that can tell you how overall market conditions affect even large companies adversely. The simple fact is short of being the CEO there's nothing you can do to avoid having your role be made redundant.

So what can you do?

### Ensure you're market ready

There are some people who tell you to always keep your Resume/CV up to date. This is really good advice that I don't follow because it's an absolute drag and I'm usually too busy living my life to bother with my Resume. If you're like me, I will still recommend keeping a list of achievements as they happen. They don't have to be properly formatted for a resume, just a cliff notes version with appropriate figures. The key point here is this list should be stored somewhere you have access to personally - a One Note document in your work account does you no good when all your access is revoked as part of the redundancy.

What I think is more important than constantly updating your Resume is what you can put on it - are the skills you're documenting going to get you hired? This doesn't have to be onerous, job boards will let you create alerts for roles you might be interested in which they'll email straight to you. Just skim this list every other month or so and get a feel for how confident you'd be applying for those roles. You can make it even easier by having multiple queries to compare and contrast. As an example, let's say you're a Frontend Developer who's experienced with Angular. You set one job alert for Frontend Developers in the salary band you want, and then copy that alert adding the 'Angular' key word. If the 'Angular' search routinely returns lots of roles, then great you're sorted. If on the other hand there's lots of Frontend roles being advertised but very few Angular ones, then it's time to update your skillset.

### Have a nest egg

I realise that this piece of advice can seem out of touch given rents are through the roof, house prices are the same, and the general cost of living, but still I feel it's valid. Simply put the more money you have saved up, the less financial stress you will be under while between roles. A redundancy (in Australia) does come with a payout - pro-rated to your length of tenure at the company - to help you find the next role. In a perfect world with an active jobs market you'll find a new role within a few weeks, which even a short tenured payout should cover. In a bad market (like the one we have currently) you might be very lucky to find a good role, or even a role at all. At the time of writing I've been out of work almost 7 months, and I've only survived financially because I banked most of my first redundancy payout.
