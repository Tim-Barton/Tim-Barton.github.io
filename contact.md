# How to best contact me (in descending order of probability I'll see it)

LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-barton]()

If you want to connect and chat, this is probably the best place to reach me. I won't give out my email to random strangers (just every faceless corporation that asks), and I've almost abandoned all other social media. So yeah, sad but true

Github : [https://github.com/Tim-Barton]()

I'm fairly active on Github at the moment with a few public repositories, so you could always open an issue on one of them, it's the high-tech version of smoke signals, but if you're desperate......

Twitter/X : [https://twitter.com/TimBartonAu]()

To be fair I'm rarely on Twitter/X these days, but it is still installed on my phone to be opened on occasion, so if there's any social media that I'm going to see it on, it's this one. (Until someone convinces me to actively try Mastadon)
