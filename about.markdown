Hi, my name is Tim.  
This is me -> (or it will be when I find a good photo to use here)

I've been a tech-nerd all my life and love to solve problems, so it was no surprise to anyone that I went to university and graduated with a Bachelor in IT (Software Engineering) - unfortunately that was in the wake of the GFC ([Global Financial Crisis](https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/the-global-financial-crisis.html) for anyone too young to remember that). It's all good though, I found a job and was soon starting to solve all sorts of Tech problems - life was good.

Then a funny thing happened: the problems I wanted to solve were no longer Tech problems - those were easy - what I wanted to solve were the meta-problems like  

* How do you get a team to work well together?
* How do you manage a project that's changing?
* What is the best way to deliver software?

Or, simply put - "How do you let developers do what they do best?"

A few more years went by as I gained more experience until finally (after some time with a foot in each camp) I joined the lowest ranks of management as a Team Leader - or "promoted into useless" as an old colleague put it. My job was now to solve to solve those meta-problems in order to get the best out of my team.

And you know what? I *like* that job. I like seeing developers able to do what they do best and deliver great products to the customer. I like seeing developers learn and grow because the practices we follow give them the chance. I like seeing a team form into a unit that is able tackle unknowns efficiently and without panic.

### So what is this site?  

First and foremost it's a place where I can start collecting my thoughts on practices and approaches to build out my personal playbook. Somewhere other than my head that is.  
Of course I could have just done that in a Google doc, or some other note-taking app, but by being public I hope I can help someone else figure out what works for them, and generally help people beyond my immediate sphere of influence.

### Why should you listen to me?  

I'm not saying you should, in fact don't take anything here as gospel, but it is my hope is that you read what I have here and it helps you form your own views on the world.  

That said, I do believe my views follow some broad general tenets that might appeal to you:

#### Is it practical?

Most software teams are working within the context of a business, and there are some things that a business needs (or think they need) that are at odds with good Development Practices. The best Ways of Working are a healthy balance between the two, but are still achievable.

#### There is no such thing as perfect

Firstly in the sense that every approach has it's pros & cons where you need to ensure the former outweigh the later. Also in the sense that every practice you follow can either be wrong for a given scenario, or become generally sub-optimal in the long run as your teams/business/needs chance, so don't get stuck thinking that your practices are "perfect".

#### If in doubt, start lite

Process creates a structure to the way you do things, a structure that is designed to help people work more effectively, but also creates a rigidity to how you approach things. Sometimes that rigidity will start to hurt your business and you need to change or remove a process, but I've found people don't like this and will resist you. Since *adding* a process is usually easier than *removing* one, I prefer starting with something lite and adding to it, rather than going whole hog and realising you've gone too far



### Notes & Addendum

This site us currently created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), so props to those communities for how easy it was to get this going
