Hi, my name is Tim.  
This is me -> ![headshot](img/headshot-2022.jpg)

If you want the full life story, I overshare in the [Introduction]({% link _posts/2023-05-16-introduction.md %}) post, but the TL;DR is after 8 years as a Developer I started a journey into management to help solve the question of "How do you let developers do what they do best?"

And you know what? I *like* that job.

* I like seeing developers being able to do what they do best and deliver great products to the customer.
* I like seeing developers learn and grow because the practices we follow give them the chance.
* I like seeing a group of developers form into a team that is able tackle unknowns efficiently and without panic.

### So what is this site?  

First and foremost it's a place where I can start collecting my thoughts on practices and approaches to build out my personal playbook. Somewhere other than my head like I have been for the last few years.  

Of course I could have just done that in a Google doc, or some other note-taking app, but by being public I hope I can help someone else figure out what works for them, and generally help people beyond my immediate sphere of influence.

### What should you expect?  

I don't want anyone to take what I write here as some sort of gospel truth, the site name is deliberate - these are the opinions of one guy who's worked in the Dev trenches and wants to make things better for everyone. I am not perfect, never have been, never will be, but I hope that by writing here I can help guide people down a path I think is good.

That said, I do believe my views follow some broad general tenets that might appeal to you:

#### Is it practical?

Most software teams are working within the context of a business, and while "Business" and "Tech" should be aligned on the outcomes, there are some things that a "Business" needs (or think they need) that are at odds with good Development Practices. The best Ways of Working are a healthy balance between the two, but are still achievable.

#### There is no such thing as perfect

Firstly in the sense that every approach has it's pros & cons where you need to ensure the former outweigh the later. Also in the sense that every practice you follow can either be wrong for a given scenario, or become generally sub-optimal in the long run as your teams/business/needs change, so don't get stuck thinking that your practices are "perfect".

#### If in doubt, start lite

Process creates a structure to the way you do things, a structure that is designed to help people work more effectively, but also creates a rigidity to how you approach things. Sometimes that rigidity will start to hurt your business and you need to change or remove a process, but I've found people don't like this and will resist you. Since *adding* a process is usually easier than *removing* one, I prefer starting with something lite and adding to it, rather than going whole hog and realising you've gone too far

### Notes & Addendum

This site is currently created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), so props to those communities for how easy it was to get this going
